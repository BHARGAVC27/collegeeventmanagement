# Nested Query Implementation - Active Students Finder

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### **What Was Built:**
A nested query system that identifies "Highly Active Students" - students who have registered for more events than the average student in the system.

---

## 🔍 Nested Query Details

### **Query Purpose:**
Find students with above-average event participation for recognition, awards, or leadership opportunities.

### **Nested Subqueries Used:**

1. **In SELECT clause:** Calculates average events per student
2. **In CASE statement:** Multiple nested queries for engagement categorization
3. **In HAVING clause:** Filters students above average using subquery
4. **Derived table:** Inner subquery creates temporary result set

### **SQL Structure:**
```sql
SELECT 
    s.name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT er.event_id) AS total_events,
    (SELECT AVG(event_count) FROM (...) AS subquery) AS avg_events  -- NESTED
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN event_registrations er ON s.id = er.student_id
GROUP BY s.id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT er.event_id) > (
    SELECT AVG(event_count) FROM (                                   -- NESTED IN HAVING
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT er2.event_id) AS event_count
        FROM students s2
        LEFT JOIN event_registrations er2 ON s2.id = er2.student_id
        GROUP BY s2.id
    ) AS student_counts
)
```

## 🚀 How to Demo

### **Step 1: Access Admin Dashboard**
- Login as admin
- Navigate to Admin Dashboard

### **Step 2: Click Active Students Tab**
- Look for green "🌟 Active Students" tab
- Click to open the section

### **Step 3: Execute Query**
- Click "🔄 Execute Query" button
- Watch loading spinner
- View results in seconds

### **Step 4: Explain to Evaluators**
> "This feature demonstrates **nested subqueries** in action. The query:
> 
> 1. Calculates the average number of events per student using a **nested subquery**
> 2. Compares each student against this average in the **HAVING clause** (another nested query)
> 3. Categorizes students using **multiple nested subqueries in CASE statements**
> 4. Returns only students who exceed the average
>
> This is useful for identifying engaged students for awards, leadership roles, or scholarships."

## 🔑 Key SQL Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Nested SELECT in Column List:** Calculate average inline
2. **Nested SELECT in WHERE/HAVING:** Filter based on subquery result
3. **Nested SELECT in CASE:** Dynamic categorization
4. **Derived Tables:** FROM (subquery) AS alias
5. **Correlation:** Inner query references outer query
6. **Aggregation in Subqueries:** AVG, COUNT within nested queries

## 📊 Sample Output

```
Roll Number | Name           | Events | Avg | Attended | Clubs | Level
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CS2021001   | Alice Johnson  | 8      | 3.2 | 7        | 3     | Highly Active
CS2021015   | Bob Smith      | 6      | 3.2 | 5        | 2     | Active
CS2021032   | Carol Davis    | 5      | 3.2 | 4        | 2     | Active
```
